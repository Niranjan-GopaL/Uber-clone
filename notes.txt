Remember These ------------------------------------------------------------------>

- I have cloned his repo in Code Practise/App Dev/  
  Just refer and understand from there and take what you can't figure out on your own

- HE TOLD THAT YARN IS MUCH MORE RELIABLE THAN NPM !!!!!!!!!! GODD LIFE SAVER
  SO YOU ARE FINALLYYYY FREEEEEEEEEEE. Fk npm and node.

- DAMNNN rm -rf from git bash is MUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH (took like 10 seconds)  
  Faster than deleting from using the windows stuff. WTFF

- React Native Elements =========>> THIS IS KINDA LIKE MUI (A READY MADE COMPONENT LIBRARY)
  WELL DOCUMENTED 
  SEE THEIR SITE :- https://reactnativeelements.com 
  (I INSTALLED USING YARN !!!!!!!!!!!! cuz I can't deal with npm sigh)

- Watch initial part of first vid to get FULL OVERVIEW , UNDERSTAND STRUCTURING etc
- It seems not all the coding part is deployed in github cuz he is pretty passionate about
  teaching which is fair. all the misc and dummy data will be in repo
